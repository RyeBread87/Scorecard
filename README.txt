This utility is a sample project to demonstrate a Windows forms utility performing the following functions:

	-Presenting a drop-down list from which to select a mock "customer" (via OleDbConnection)
	-Using the selected customer to query relevant data for that customer from a data source (also via OleDbConnection)
	-The 46 queried points of data are put in a Customer object and used to generate a scorecard spreadsheet as output
	-Errors are logged to text files - these begin with "errors_" and are saved to the C:\Users\Public folder
	-A BackgroundWorker is used to perform the tasks of collecting customer data & saving the output spreadsheet while reporting progress to the user

This relies on the following files all being located in the C:\Users\Public folder:

	-CustomerList.xlsx
		-This file contains a simple list of "customers", which serves as the data source for the drop-down list in the scorecard utility
	-Customers.xlsx
		-This file contains the customer data which the app will read from & write to scorecards it generates for selected customers
	-scorecard_template.xlsx
		-This file is a template for the scorecards to be generated by the app - it contains all the formatting and blanks to be filled in by a given customer's data
